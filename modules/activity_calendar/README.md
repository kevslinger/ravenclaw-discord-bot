# Activity Calendar Module

## Sort of a WIP at the moment

The idea is you can add activities to a monthlong calendar
which is held on a google sheet. You can view either the monthlong or
a weekly calendar. Also, the bot
will announce the day before an activity happens/is due, to let everyone
know!
- `~addactivity Dueling Tuesday, August 3rd 10pm EDT https://www.reddit.com/r/Dueling`
will add this Dueling to the calendar
- `~deleteactivity Dueling` will delete all instances of Dueling from the calendar
- `~showcalendar` will show all activities for the month
- `~showweek` will show all activities in the next week
